        <p>I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in software development. However, within
          a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft skills required for
          being a software developer. <br> <br>

          So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer.

        <p>Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in the real world space. I had an immense
          learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. The learning was fun and there were
          some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
          <br> <br>

          Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.

        waiting for.
